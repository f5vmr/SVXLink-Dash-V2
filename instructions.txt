Having installed the new dashboard and associated everything go to the terminal and open it.
sudo nano /etc/svxlink/svxlink.conf

If you are using [SimplexLogic] or [RepeaterLogic] the directions are identical.
Where you have TX=Tx1 replace the Tx1 with MultiTx

Scroll down to [MultiTx]

make the content exactly like this

[MultiTx]
TYPE = Multi
TRANSMITTERS = Tx1,TxStream

now create a new sector just above [Tx1]
and paste this
[TxStream]
TYPE = Local
AUDIO_DEV = alsa:plughw:Loopback,0,0
AUDIO_CHANNEL = 0
PTT_TYPE = NONE
TIMEOUT = 7200
TX_DELAY = 0
PREEMPHASIS = 0

save the file.

Now sudo nano /etc/asound.conf

Whatever you have in here - remove it (ctrl-k on each line will do that)
and paste the following.
pcm.loophw {
    type hw
    card Loopback
    device 0
    subdevice 0
}

pcm.loopout {
    type plug
    slave.pcm "loophw"
}
and save the file.
Finally in the command line type 
sudo alsactl nrestore 
ignore any errors, that's just a bug in alsa that had been around for years.
 Now sudo systemctl svxlink svxlink-node - or reboot if you are really paranoid.
 
 Now the RxMonitor button should work for you.
